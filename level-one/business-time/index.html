    <p>I know what you are thinking right now. "Hey that is cheating, isnt it?"<br>Well here's the thing, it is only cheating if it is written in the rules. Besides who doesn't want to take their enemies down with a flying ferret?<br>We think its is the funniest way to vanquish all foes. You can hold four ferrets in the weapon. Meaning you can rapidly take down people while practicing your villianous laugh.</p>
