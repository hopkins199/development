    <p>Well, you reached this page so you must wondering if we were dropped on our heads as children. I cannot speak for everyone on our team but there is a soft maybe. We all got tired of being beating all the time in Airsoft and Paintball. So we came up with a hilarious solution to the problem.<br>After being bitten too many times by people's pet ferrets is how the conclusion to use ferets came about. We had to shop at a lot of pet stores to get the supply we needed to get our product right. Needless to say asking to buy 50 ferrets will get you strange looks.<br> Our small team is secretly homebased in the basement of our local high school. Go Sports! We cannot fully disclose our location due to those pesky PETA people. Anywho we hope you enjoy our story and our hilarious product. Happy Hunting! </p>
